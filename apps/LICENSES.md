I have gotten a lot of requests about bundling the command line executables, or releasing the source code to KZIP and PNGOUT. This is my license (updated 01/16/2021):

- You may use PNGOUT- or KZIP-compressed content for non-commercial or commercial purposes.
- Redistributing, repackaging, or reusing the PNGOUT or KZIP executable is permitted for non-commercial projects that are distributed freely.
- For commercial requests (such as bundling with a commercial product), please write to my business partner, David Blake.
- When bundling, my credit (both my name and website) must be clearly displayed in some reasonable fashion that can be seen by an average user.
